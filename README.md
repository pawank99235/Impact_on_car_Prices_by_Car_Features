The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, with a growing focus 
on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. With increasing 
competition among manufacturers and a changing consumer landscape, it has become more 
important than ever to understand the factors that drive consumer demand for cars. In recent years, 
there has been a growing trend towards electric and hybrid vehicles and increased interest in 
alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen and natural gas. At the same time, traditional gasolinepowered cars remain dominant in the market, with varying fuel types and grades available to 
consumers.
For the given dataset, as a Data Analyst, the client has asked How can a car manufacturer optimize 
pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer 
demand? This problem could be approached by analyzing the relationship between a car's features, 
market category, and pricing, and identifying which features and categories are most popular among 
consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer. By using data analysis techniques such as 
regression analysis and market segmentation, the manufacturer could develop a pricing strategy that 
balances consumer demand with profitability, and identify which product features to focus on in 
future product development efforts. This could help the manufacturer improve its competitiveness in 
the market and increase its profitability over time.
Data Description :
The dataset contains information on various car models and their specifications, and is titled "Car 
Features and MSRP". It was collected and made available on Kaggle by Cooper Union, a private 
college located in New York City.
The dataset contains information on over 11,000 car models and their specifications, including 
details on the car's make, model, year, fuel type, engine power, transmission, wheels, number of 
doors, market category, size, style, estimated miles per gallon, popularity, and manufacturer's 
suggested retail price (MSRP).
Overall, this dataset could be a valuable resource for data analysts interested in exploring various 
aspects of the automotive industry and could provide insights that could inform decisions related to 
product development, marketing, and pricing.
This dataset contains 11915 rows and 16 columns before cleaning the dataset.
But after handling the all null values the dataset could have 11813 rows and 16 columns are present 
in the new dataset.
By examining the popularity variable in the dataset, We could identify which features are most 
popular among consumers and how they affect a car's popularity. This could help manufacturers 
make informed decisions about product development and marketing. Predicting the price of a car 
based on its features and market category: By using the various features and market category 
variables in the dataset, a data could develop a model to predict the price of a car. This could help 
manufacturers and consumers understand how different features affect the price of a car and make 
informed decisions about pricing and purchasing
